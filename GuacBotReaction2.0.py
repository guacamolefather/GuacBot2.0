The vet gave me some anti biotic drops to put in his food but when I‚Äôd do that Franki wouldn‚Äôt touch it. So, the vet suggested using a small dropper tube to insert the medicine directly into his anus. The first time was absolute hell, my cat fought me the whole time but once the tube was in and the medicine pushed out he seemed to calm quite a bit. Well the next day he was acting strange, he has always been an independent cat, rarely coming around, never wanting to be held, but as I sat on the couch he started walking back and forth meowing and rubbing my leg. He then went and jumped up on the table where we‚Äôd done the application the night before and meowed louder and louder until I decided I guess we will go ahead and do the medicine treatment. This time he didn‚Äôt fight me though, and when I inserted the tube he closed his eyes, stretched his neck, and let out a noise that can only be described as a moan of pure ecstasy. Maybe the medicine made him feel better, I supposed. That night he slept on my bed curled up right next to me, which he had never done before. For the next week he‚Äôd do the same thing every day, meow on the table until he got his ‚Äòfix‚Äô... But then the medicine ran out. Even though I had no medicine he‚Äôd still cry and beg for it, I thought maybe if I insert it without medicine he will realize it doesn‚Äôt make him feel better anymore and forget about it. Well that was 2 weeks ago and he is only getting worse. He walks around me all day with his tail up presenting his rectum and trying to entice me. He is demanding insertions more and more often. Yesterday I caught him looking longingly at the turkey baster... When I sit he jumps in my lap purring and rubbing me affectionately. It was then in horror I realized my cat thinks I‚Äôm his gay lover, and that I‚Äôve been sexually pleasing him for weeks now. Needless to say the sexual tension between us is palpable. How do I let my cat know that I‚Äôm not gay, but still like him as a friend?", "32", "33", "34", "35", """Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me\nI ain't the sharpest tool in the shed\nShe was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb\nIn the shape of an "L" on her forehead\nWell the years start coming and they don't stop coming\nFed to the rules and I hit the ground running\nDidn't make sense not to live for fun\nYour brain gets smart but your head gets dumb\nSo much to do, so much to see\nSo what's wrong with taking the back streets?\nYou'll never know if you don't go\nYou'll never shine if you don't glow\nHey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play\nHey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid\nAnd all that glitters is gold\nOnly shooting stars break the mold\nIt's a cool place and they say it gets colder\nYou're bundled up now, wait till you get older\nBut the meteor men beg to differ\nJudging by the hole in the satellite picture\nThe ice we skate is getting pretty thin\nThe water's getting warm so you might as well swim\nMy world's on fire, how about yours?\nThat's the way I like it and I never get bored\nHey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play\nHey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid\nAll that glitters is gold\nOnly shooting stars break the mold\nHey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play\nHey now, you're a rock star, get the show, on get paid\nAnd all that glitters is gold\nOnly shooting stars\nSomebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?\nI need to get myself away from this place\nI said yep what a concept\nI could use a little fuel myself\nAnd we could all use a little change\nWell, the years start coming and they don't stop coming\nFed to the rules and I hit the ground running\nDidn't make sense not to live for fun\nYour brain gets smart but your head gets dumb\nSo much to do, so much to see\nSo what's wrong with taking the back streets?\nYou'll never know if you don't go (go!)\nYou'll never shine if you don't glow\nHey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play\nHey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid\nAnd all that glitters is gold\nOnly shooting stars break the mold\nAnd all that glitters is gold\nOnly shooting stars break the mold"""]
